Writer’s block isn’t just a lack of words—it’s a signal from your creative self that something deeper needs attention. I’ve faced it more than once, and each time, the symptoms are familiar: a sense of malaise, a lack of excitement, and a gnawing dissatisfaction with the work. Sometimes I avoid the page entirely, escaping into distractions, knowing in my gut that something isn’t right.

Over time, I’ve learned that these feelings are not obstacles, but invitations. They’re my mind and heart telling me that the story’s direction needs to change. When I give myself a few days to step back and reflect, I return with a willingness to pivot, to seek new possibilities that reignite my enthusiasm and improve the narrative.

For example, in my Tharsolketha world, I once wrote a scene where Thane rejected the Vashkethirana job and abandoned Axian. It was dramatic, but it didn’t fit. Thane, whose name means “sacred burden,” would never abandon his adopted son after years of devotion. By revisiting Thane’s backstory and motivations, I discovered a richer, more authentic character—one who deepened the story and opened new paths forward.

The lesson? Be patient with yourself. Read the shimmer, read the shine. Don’t give up when the way forward seems blocked. Instead, listen for what your creative intuition is trying to say.

And most importantly, don’t get too attached to any one idea or scene. If something isn’t working, be ruthless. Sentimentality can cloud judgment—especially for those scenes or concepts you love most. Sometimes, letting go is the only way to make room for something better.

Writer’s block is not the end—it’s a turning point. Trust yourself to find it, and let your song unfold.
